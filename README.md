# pSZ-cross-Shear
This repository contains Python code implementing the polarized Sunyaev-Zeldovich (pSZ) and galaxy shear power spectra discussed in [Philcox+22](COMING SOON). The main contributions are sourced by:
- Weak lensing (shear; scalars and tensors)
- Intrinsic alignments (shear; scalars and tensors)
- The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (pSZ; scalars)
- The Sachs-Wolfe effect (pSZ; scalars)
- Doppler shifts (pSZ; scalars)
- Gravitational waves (pSZ; tensors)

We include Fisher forecasts for the pSZ and shear auto- and cross-power spectra, allowing the detectability of various components to be assessed.
